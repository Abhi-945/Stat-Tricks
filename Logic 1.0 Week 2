#Logic for the ideation stage

1. Start
    Understanding the Distribution of the Data
    Students score low in the first days and then score high at the end
2. Imputation process for missing values
    We tried Mean, Median, KNN, Iterative Imputer(MICE)
    Compared each with Density plots and r2 score
    Mice turns out to be best imputation method
3. Predicting future values
    Calculated slope and Y-intercept values from Week 1 and Week 2 data.
    used formula (Slope*X + Y-Intercept) to predict Week 3 values
4. Quality process for imputation
    Density plots used to verify Imputation methods
    r2 score used to verify Imputation method
    Due to the Randomness present in the data, we got extremely low r2 score value.
5. End
