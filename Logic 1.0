#Logic for the ideation stage

1. Start
Firstly we had imported the data file containing all the marks of 1000 students along with the missing values in R.
Then we used R to calculate how many of the values are actually missing.
For this we loaded a package 'mice' which is quite useful in handling missing data.
we used md.pattern(data) to find out total number of missing values, which came out as 687.
R code:
library(mice)
md.pattern(data)
summary(data)

2. Imputation process for missing values
then we used the mice function for the colums 2-6 as they had values to be imputed.
We took a seed value of 500.
using 'mice' and 'complete' we found the missing values and placed them at their orignal place.
We stored our new dataset with all the values in the variable 'completed'.
R code:
impute<-mice(data[,2:6],seed = 500)
print(impute)
impute$imp$M
completed<-complete(impute,1)
View(completed)
summary(completed)


3. Predicting future values
Our next task was to predict the future values using this week's data which we had just stored in the completed variable.
We created a linear model for prediction as we did not have enough history for our data and any other model did not seem appropriate.
we used 'lm' function to create a linear model.
We had to make 5 models each having one continous respone variable and 4 predictor variables.
After constructing the models we used 'predict' function to predict the data of each day of 1000 students.
After succesfully predicting the next week's data we used cbind and stored in pr1 which is now our predicted values for week 2.
R code:
model<-lm(completed$F~completed$M+completed$T+completed$W+completed$TH,data=completed)
model$coefficients
fri<-predict(model,completed)
View(fri)
pr1<-cbind(mon,tue,wed,thur,fri)
View(pr1)

4. Quality process for imputation
