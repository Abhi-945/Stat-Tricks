#Logic for the ideation stage

1. Start
Firstly, in order to find the distribution of the data given to us, we have used R to plot histogram of the marks of each student using their mean computed through excel.
We have used histogram because it gives a better picture of skewness present in the data. The data shows a negatively skewed curve.
The code is:
>install.packages("ggplot2")     #package for plotting graphs
>mydata<-read.csv("Bookk2.csv")  #for reading the excel sheet converted csv file uploaded on R cloud
>hist(mydata$mean)

2. Imputation process for missing values
Imputation for missing values has been done using excel by calculating mean value of marks of each student and replacing the missing value in each row by the same.
Mean imputation has been chosen over median and mode imputation because mean is considered to be the ideal measure of central tendency. For checking the accuracy 
of mean imputation, we have calculated root mean squared error which comes out to be leastt of mean imputed values when compared with median imputed values.

3. Predicting future values
For prediction of future values or next week's marks, multiple linear regression model technique has been used on R. The code is:
> file<-read.csv("myfile.csv")    #for reading the excel sheet converted csv file uploaded on R cloud
> head(file)     #file has 1000 observations of 5 variables (week 2's marks of each student of all 5 days)
Since we have multiple target variables (5 target variables representing each day of the week 3), linear regression can only be applied by making 5 different models 
corresponding to each day of the week as linear regression works with single target variable only. So the code for making 5 multiple linear regression models (having
one response and four predictor variables in each model) and predicting values using lm and predict function is as follows:
> model1 <- lm(M~T+W+TH+F, data = file)
> summary(model1)
> model2 <- lm(T~M+W+TH+F, data = file)
> summary(model2)
> model3 <- lm(W~M+T+TH+F, data = file)
> summary(model3)
> model4 <- lm(TH~M+T+W+F, data = file)
> summary(model4)
> model5 <- lm(F~M+T+W+TH, data = file)
> summary(model5)
> pred1<-predict(model1,file)
> pred2<-predict(model2,file)
> pred3<-predict(model3,file)
> pred4<-predict(model4,file)
> pred5<-predict(model5,file)

4. Quality process for prediction
In order to check the model quality, we can observe the value of R square showing by the summary function used after making the model, which depicts the proportion
of variation explained by each model from the true value of response variable. Higher the value of R square, higher the model accuracy level.
