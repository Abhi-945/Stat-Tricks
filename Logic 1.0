#Logic for the ideation stage

1. Start
We have imported data in Python and we have checked how many missing values present in the data.
There are 687 missing values in the dataset

2. Imputation process for missing values
Imputation by mean method
We use mean method for imputation, because  data is interval scale data and data is less variable for each student.

# Imputation by mean method
m=round(df.mean(axis=1))
for i,col in enumerate(df):
      df.iloc[:, i] = df.iloc[:,i].fillna(m)
 
print(df)

3. Predicting future values

4. Quality process for imputation
5. End
