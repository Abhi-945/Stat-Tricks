1. Start
    Understanding the Distribution of the Data
    Students score low in the first days and then score high at the end
2. Missingness present in data
    MISSING COMPLETELY AT RANDOM (MCAR), MISSING AT RANDOM (MAR), MISSING NOT AT RANDOM.
    Made data matrix using msno to detect pattern between filled and missing values
    concluded that it follows MAR therefore Missing values can be filled with the observed data
3. Imputation process for missing values
    KNN, Iterative Imputer(MICE)
    Compared each with Density plots and r2 score
    Mice turns out to be best imputation method
4.  Skewness & Kurtosis
    Calculated four moments of data. To use for following:
    SKEWNESS (Population), SAMPLE SKEWNESS, STANDARD  ERROR IN SKEWNESS, 95% PERCENT CONFIDENCE INTERVAL OF POPULATION SKEWNESS
    KURTOSIS, EXCESS KURTOSIS OF POPULATION, SAMPLE EXCESS KURTOSIS, STANDARD ERROR IN KURTOSIS, TEST STATISTIC(Kurtosis)
5.  Visualising Distribution
    Used ECDF to show distribution of data.
    Simulated Normal Distribution from Mean and STD of the data. To show that it follows Normal Distribution.
5. Predicting future values
    Used Feature Importance to calculate which of the Week 3 days contribute most for a particular day in Week 3.
    Using the most contrabutary variables, I have predicted the data of each day for Week 4.    
6. Quality process for imputation
    Data matrix used to identify Missingness present in data
    Density plots used to verify Imputation methods
    Moments of data used to calculate Skewness and Kurtosis
    Simulation and ECDF used to confirm the distribution of data.
    r2 score used to prediction
7. End
