1. arranged the data
2. find the central tendency of the data
3. skewness and kurtosis
4. repesent graphically
    checked the distribution of data
    for monday of every week the data is uniformally distributed
    for friday it is inceasing exponentially as it is skewed left
    for thusday also the distribution is same as friday but can be bimodel disribution
    for tuesday the dat is uniformally distibuted but can be multimodel disribution
    for wed the data is symetrically but some part is exponential increasing
    
    
 5. impute the missing values 
 using KNN accuray
 89
 using MICE accuray
 87
 using other imputer
 like 
 mean,  median, constant, most frequent
 the accuracy is upto 10-45 %
 
 6. after that I used VRA time series algorithm 
 with gives the accuracy of 95 % with our predicted data
 and Mean squered error is 3.9%
